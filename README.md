Hello, this is SERAPHSOPENSSTANDLY, an open source project that aims to make it easier to develop simple games based on Seraph’s Last Stand, an indie action and survival game created by Andrezitos Gameplays. This project contains python, js, ts, json, array, object, bigString files and a json database in py. It also contains functions for animations, graphics, sounds, physics, interface and logic.

Motivation
I am a programmer who loves simple and fun games. One day I bought Seraph’s Last Stand, a game that caught my attention for its simplicity and challenge. I got addicted to the game and was impressed by Andrezitos Gameplays’ work. I also noticed some bugs in the game and wanted to fix them or even increase them to see how far the game could go. I tried to contact Andrezitos by email to ask for access to the game data, but I got no response (or I got it and didn’t see it). Then I watched his last video and was inspired to create an open source of Seraph’s Last Stand. The idea is that this is a library or framework that can help anyone create their own simple games, using the elements of Seraph’s Last Stand as a base. I started by making a commit of a pack of faces that I made with characters, very cool. Feel free to add new faces or create other packs of bodies, hats, weapons, enemies, scenarios, etc. I’m not very good at software architecture because I’m still learning, but I believe I’m an ant trying to create an anthill. So I invite you to at least browse through the codes and imagine what games this Openzão can create!!! For those who have doubts I will post some links of the original game and the respective Andrezitos Gameplays. Please don’t sue me for admiring your work so much that I want the whole internet to create seraphs for me!!! After the important links there will be a read.me in English that some gpt made for me, for the gringo to think that the project is serious and well articulated kkkkkk we are together future gamers(makers) (>-)> (>-)> (>-<) <(-<) <(-)> (>-)> ( - ) (-) (_) (.)
